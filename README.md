# Arctic Ecology Simulation

### This project aims at developing an agent based model which simulates the life of arctic species. The system will start with two agents, namely the Polar Bear and the Ringed Seal. The system will simulate inter species interactions, intra species interactions as well as interactions between the agents and the environment.
